# 50in100projects

50 HTML, CSS (SCSS) and Vanila JS projects in 100 days

This is the general repository for the entire project. Each html page is a different small project, some components for websites (loaders, sliders, cards, buttons, animations), some fun games (tictactoe, pong, guess my number), some fun with APIs (dogAPI, MovieDB, Pokemon, Rick&Morty) and other interesting things (beer measurement converter, fun with svgs and more)

The goal is to add one new project every day until I'm finished. Currently on project 21/50.

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions to improve.
Feel free to use any of the components for your own projects.
