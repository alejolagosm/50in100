# 50in100projects

50 HTML, CSS (SCSS) and Vanila JS projects in 100 days

This is the general repository for the entire project. Each html page is a different small project.

Most of the projects are based on the course by Brad Traversy at
https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/
But I tried to add its own little twist to each project.

You can find:
Some cool components for websites:

- loaders
- sliders
- cards
- buttons
- animations
  Some fun games:
- Tictactoe
- Pong
- Guess my number)
  Some fun with APIs:
- dogAPI
- MovieDB
- Pokemon
- Rick&Morty
  Other interesting things:
- beer measurement converter.
- fun with svgs
  And other things...

The goal is to add one new project every day until I'm finished. Currently on project 27/50.

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions to improve.
Feel free to use any of the components for your own projects.
