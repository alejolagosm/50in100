50 HTML, CSS (SCSS) and Vanila JS projects in 100 days

Each html page is a different small project.

Most of the projects are based on the course by Brad Traversy at

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions to improve.

Obviously, feel free to use any of the components for your own projects, these are not original ideas, I am just using them to learn and for portfolio purposes.
