50 HTML, CSS (SCSS) and Vanila JS projects

Each html page is a different fron-end mini project.

Most of the ideas for each projects are based on the course by Brad Traversy at https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

I tried to add my own little twist to each project, and some other ideas I found along the way.

Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions to improve.
